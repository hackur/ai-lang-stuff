# GitHub Push Fix - OAuth Workflow Scope Issue

## Problem
```
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/hackur/ai-lang-stuff.git'
! [remote rejected] hackur/ai-lang-stuff -> hackur/ai-lang-stuff
(refusing to allow an OAuth App to create or update workflow `.github/workflows/README.md` without `workflow` scope)
```

## Root Cause
Your OAuth token doesn't have the `workflow` scope, which is required to push files in `.github/workflows/` directory.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Create a Personal Access Token with Workflow Scope (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Go to GitHub Settings**:
   - Navigate to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Or: GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)

2. **Generate New Token**:
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a descriptive name: "ai-lang-stuff CLI push"
   - Set expiration as needed

3. **Select Scopes**:
   - ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - ✅ `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)

4. **Generate and Copy Token**:
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again)

5. **Update Git Credentials**:
   ```bash
   # Update the remote URL with your new token
   git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/hackur/ai-lang-stuff.git

   # Or use GitHub CLI to handle authentication
   gh auth login
   ```

6. **Push Again**:
   ```bash
   git push origin hackur/ai-lang-stuff
   ```

### Option 2: Use GitHub CLI (EASIEST)

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
brew install gh

# Login (this will handle authentication properly)
gh auth login

# Follow prompts:
# - Choose HTTPS
# - Authenticate with GitHub.com
# - Choose "Login with a web browser"
# - Paste the one-time code
# - Authorize in browser

# Push using gh
gh repo set-default hackur/ai-lang-stuff
git push
```

### Option 3: Use SSH Instead of HTTPS

```bash
# Generate SSH key if you don't have one
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Add SSH key to ssh-agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Copy public key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Add this to GitHub: Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key

# Update remote to use SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:hackur/ai-lang-stuff.git

# Push
git push origin hackur/ai-lang-stuff
```

## Quick Fix for This Session

If you need to push immediately and deal with auth later:

```bash
# Temporarily remove workflow files from staging
git rm --cached .github/workflows/*
git commit -m "temp: remove workflows for push"

# Push
git push origin hackur/ai-lang-stuff

# Re-add workflows
git revert HEAD
git push origin hackur/ai-lang-stuff
```

## Recommended Approach

**Use GitHub CLI (Option 2)** - it's the easiest and most secure:

```bash
# One-time setup
brew install gh
gh auth login

# Then just use git normally
git push
```

## Verify Success

After fixing authentication, verify the push:

```bash
git push origin hackur/ai-lang-stuff --verbose
```

You should see:
```
Writing objects: 100% (294/294), done.
To https://github.com/hackur/ai-lang-stuff.git
   3ad82bc..52f0d2e  hackur/ai-lang-stuff -> hackur/ai-lang-stuff
```
