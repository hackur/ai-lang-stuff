# Sprint 1 Execution Plan - Immediate Implementation

## Goal
Build working MCP integrations, core utilities, and foundational examples to demonstrate complete local AI capabilities.

## Duration
Today - execute 20+ tasks in parallel groups

---

## Task Groups (Parallel Execution)

### Group 1: Infrastructure (Parallel) - 5 tasks
- [ ] Create src/ directory structure
- [ ] Build config loader (src/config/loader.py)
- [ ] Build logging utility (src/utils/logging.py)
- [ ] Build retry decorator (src/utils/retry.py)
- [ ] Create __init__.py files for imports

**Can execute in parallel** - no dependencies

### Group 2: MCP Servers (Parallel) - 3 tasks
- [ ] Filesystem MCP server (mcp-servers/custom/filesystem/server.py)
- [ ] Web search MCP stub (mcp-servers/custom/web-search/server.py)
- [ ] MCP test utilities (mcp-servers/custom/test_utils.py)

**Can execute in parallel** - independent implementations

### Group 3: Examples (Sequential dependencies) - 4 tasks
- [ ] MCP filesystem agent (examples/02-mcp/filesystem_agent.py)
- [ ] Multi-tool agent (examples/02-mcp/multi_tool_agent.py)
- [ ] Basic RAG system (examples/04-rag/basic_rag.py)
- [ ] Intro notebook (notebooks/01-intro.ipynb)

**Must wait for Group 1 utilities**

### Group 4: Tests (Parallel after Groups 1-3) - 4 tasks
- [ ] Utility tests (tests/test_utils.py)
- [ ] MCP server tests (tests/test_mcp_servers.py)
- [ ] Example integration tests (tests/integration/test_examples.py)
- [ ] Smoke tests (tests/smoke/test_quick.py)

**Can execute in parallel** once dependencies exist

### Group 5: Automation (Parallel) - 3 tasks
- [ ] Pre-commit config (.pre-commit-config.yaml)
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- [ ] Template generator (scripts/generate.py)

**Can execute in parallel** - infrastructure tasks

### Group 6: Documentation (Sequential) - 4 tasks
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] Milestone 2 guide (plans/milestones/milestone-2-mcp.md)
- [ ] Update README with new examples
- [ ] Update PROJECT_STATUS

**Must wait for implementations to document**

### Group 7: Quality & Planning (Sequential) - 2 tasks
- [ ] Run all tests, fix bugs
- [ ] Retrospective and next sprint plan

**Must be last**

---

## Execution Order

### Wave 1: Infrastructure (Start immediately, parallel)
```bash
# Create all utilities and directory structure simultaneously
# Estimated: 15 minutes
```

### Wave 2: MCP Servers (After Wave 1 completes, parallel)
```bash
# Implement MCP servers using utilities from Wave 1
# Estimated: 20 minutes
```

### Wave 3: Examples (After Wave 2, can start some in parallel)
```bash
# Build examples using utilities and MCP servers
# Estimated: 25 minutes
```

### Wave 4: Tests (After Wave 3, parallel)
```bash
# Test everything that was built
# Estimated: 15 minutes
```

### Wave 5: Automation (Parallel with tests)
```bash
# Set up CI/CD and tooling
# Estimated: 10 minutes
```

### Wave 6: Documentation (After implementation complete)
```bash
# Document what was built
# Estimated: 20 minutes
```

### Wave 7: Quality Assurance (Final)
```bash
# Test everything, fix bugs, retrospective
# Estimated: 15 minutes
```

**Total Estimated Time: 120 minutes (2 hours)**

---

## Success Metrics

Sprint succeeds when:
- [ ] All 23 tasks completed
- [ ] At least 2 working MCP examples
- [ ] Core utilities functional and tested
- [ ] RAG example working end-to-end
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline functional
- [ ] Documentation updated

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk**: MCP servers complex to implement
**Mitigation**: Start with simple filesystem ops, stub complex features

**Risk**: Tests may fail on first run
**Mitigation**: Allocate time for debugging and fixes

**Risk**: Parallel execution may miss dependencies
**Mitigation**: Clearly defined wave structure prevents issues
